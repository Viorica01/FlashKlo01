                        <h4>Paris Haute Couture</h4>
                        <p>
                            Haute couture is the creation of impeccable, custom-fitted high-end fashion design that today is partially constructed by hand and often utilizes other handmade, one-of-a-kind embellishments, notions and trimmings. 
                            Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, Charles Frederick Worth made a name for himself dressing the then French Empress Eugenie (wife of Napoleon III) and placed himself at the centre of an industry that grew out of traditional French dressmaking whose focus on making outfits from high-quality, expensive, often unusual fabric were best solidified in the 17th and 18th Centuries at the courts of Louis XIV, XV, and XVI. 
                            Couture translates literally from French as "dressmaking", sewing, or needlework and is also used as a common abbreviation of haute couture and can often refer to the same thing in spirit. 
                            Haute translates literally to "high".

                        <p>
                            During Miami Swim Week, tents dot the sands of South Beach and models sashay down runways that surround or even cover the pools of some of the destination’s most popular hotels. 
                            It’s a global event that offers the chance to look ahead at fashion trends, mingle with designers, and watch models of all shapes and sizes show the latest in swimwear, resort wear and summer fashion trends.

                        <h4>New York Fashion Week</h4>
                        <p>
                            New York Fashion Week (NYFW), held in February and September of each year, is a semi-annual series of events (generally lasting 7–9 days) when international fashion collections are shown to buyers, the press, and the general public. It is one of four major fashion weeks in the world, collectively known as the "Big 4", along with those in Paris, London, and Milan.  
                            The Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) created the modern notion of a centralized "New York Fashion Week" in 1993, although cities like London were already using their city's name in conjunction with the words fashion week in the 1980s. 
                            NYFW is based on a much older series of events called "Press Week", founded in 1943.

                        <h4>Milan Fashion Week</h4>
                        <p>
                            Milan Fashion Week is a clothing trade show held semi-annually in Milan, Italy. The autumn/winter event is held in February/March of each year, and the spring/summer event is held in September/October of each year. 
                            Milan Fashion Week, which was established in 1958, is part of the global "Big Four fashion weeks", the others being Paris Fashion Week, London Fashion Week and New York Fashion Week. The schedule begins with New York, followed by London, and then Milan, and ending with Paris. 
                            Since the year 1958, Milan Fashion Week has been taking place semi-annually with a women and a men’s fashion week.
